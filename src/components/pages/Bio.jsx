            <p>
                I have over 20 years of experience in the IT field starting back in 1996 as a mainframe Change Controller with South African Airways (SAA) and many years as an MS SQL database Administrator for a number of different companies ending as an Enterprise Domain/Server Administrator with SITA in 2016. <br />
                <br />
                After which I co-founded a web development and digital marketing consultancy, and re-skilled myself as a web developer creating and maintaining web-enabled solutions for a small number of private clients. In 2020 I upgrade my skill-set by completing an online boot camp where I learned JavaScript, HTML & CSS, and the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs) Full-Stack. This also included exposure to git/GitHub, Firebase/Firestore, Netlify, and a number of related technologies<br />

                I'm passionate about creating innovative, customized solutions for my clients, that harness the best technologies and methodologies to meet and exceed their expectations. I understand that websites and the solutions I offer are critical to my client's business success and that this requires constant open and honest communication between us.<br />
